# ai-prompts-wildcards
Wildcard prompt lists to be used with ai generation tools like [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus) using [Stable Diffusion AI](https://stability.ai/stable-image) SDLX, SDLX-Turbo, etc.

## Installation
Made for use with Fooocus ai generation but can be used for other tools. To install just copy the files you want to use directly into ```/Fooocus/Fooocus/wildcards```. Make sure the files are directly in that path and not in subfolders.

## Usage
1. Reload Fooocus or the engine you are using.
2. In the prompt enter `__WildcardFilename__` where WildcardFilename is the filename containing the wildcards you want to use.
